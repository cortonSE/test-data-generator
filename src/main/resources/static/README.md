rdf2html
========

a javascript library to visualize an array of RDF triples into an HTML page

Current stage: `planning - alpha version`

## Usage

### HTML skeleton ###

We use a HTML data attribute `data-rdftohtml-plugin` to determine where to inject HTML generated from the plugins, for example for the map plugin:

```html
<div data-rdftohtml-plugin='map'></div>
```

Somewhere in the HTML code, you should include the triples in turtle format:

```html
<script id="turtle" type="text/turtle">
    @base <http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/oh#> .
    @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
    <http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/oh> a owl:Ontology;
</script>
```

You can customize this HTML to fit your page's lay-out.

To trigger the plugin, you will need to add the following script to your HTML code:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    var triples = document.getElementById("turtle").innerHTML;
    var config = {}; // Won't call any plugins
    rdf2html(triples, config);
</script>
```

### Configuration ###

By default, the empty `config` object won't do anything.
Every plugin you want to enable must be declared inside this object as follows:

```javascript
var config = { plugins: ['triples', 'map', 'ontology', 'paging'] };
```

Each plugin can accept its own configuration, this requires the `plugins` array to be represented as a dictionary:

```javascript
var config = {
    plugins: {
        triples: true,
        map: {
            // Base path on which the assets are provided
            assetsBase: '/assets'
        },
        ontology: true,
        paging: true
    }
};
```

Using `true` or `{}` as plugin value, or not providing specific fields will cause the plugin to use its default configuration for those fields. 

Custom plugins can be added in this dictionary representation by simply adding a new element as follows:

```javascript
var config = {
    plugins: {
        ...
        myCustomPlugin: {
            // This callback is called once, 'db' contains all declared triples.
            callback: function(db, container, prefixes, config) {
                console.log(db.find('http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/oh', null, null));
            }
        }
        ...
    }
};
```

The `callback` field is the actual entry point of the plugin.

For debugging purposes, the config can also contain a `verbose` boolean field.

### A visualizer for your vocabulary ###

Some guidelines:

You're creating a particular visualization: e.g., you want to display an ontology, you want to display something on a map, you want to show some meta-data, etc. If there is already a visualization for what you want to do, e.g., a map or an ontology visualizer, integrate it in the specific code. If you want to do something completely new, then go ahead and add your own javascript class.
